### Instruction
When the sketch first loads, the image appears as a static 64×64 mosaic of colored blocks, reconstructed from the original Mondrian painting.
Pressing the **`A`** key on the keyboard **toggles the animation on/off**:
Before pressing `A`: Only the static mosaic is visible.
After pressing `A`: Color blocks begin moving by hue, points move and leave vibrant trajectories across the image.

### Drive Part
I chose to animate the image using **Perlin noise**.
